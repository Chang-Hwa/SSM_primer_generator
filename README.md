# `SSM_workflow`

The workflow is used for site-saturation mutagenesis (SSM) library preparation, designed to hugely decrease the time effort potential users put into when preparing SSM libraries.

The workflow enables:

- Determination of *N* mutation sites for the SSM targeting activity enrichment for your protein of interest
- Generation of *N* primer pairs ready for order

Users need to prepare three items in advance:

- Protein structure/model
- Protein sequence
- Gene sequence

There are multiple ways to create SSM libraries. This workflow follows the method in ["Biocatalytic oxidative cross-coupling reactions for biaryl bond formation"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04365-7#Sec3).
